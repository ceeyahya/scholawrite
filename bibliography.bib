  abstract = {The structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) is the standard structured method used for computer projects in UK government departments. It is also being adopted as a standard by various other bodies. Responsibility for SSADM belongs to the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), HM Treasury although support and training may be acquired through commercial organizations. SSADM has certain underlying principles and consists of six stages which are broken down into a number of steps and tasks. Within this framework, a number of structured techniques are used and documents produced. SSADM may be compared with methods that use some of the same techniques. Two other methods (Yourdon and Arthur Young's Information Engineering) are briefly described and some comparisons drawn with SSADM.},

  abstract = {The structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) gives the analyst several sets of standards to help in the specification of requirements: techniques and procedures (tools); tasks to be performed (structural standards); and documentation standards. These three are used in conjunction with the skills and experience of the analyst to build up a specification of requirements that can readily be translated into a design. It is possible to define five broad categories of requirement: functions, data, non-functional, goals and implementation/design. Each of these requirement types are outlined.{$<>$}},
